<h2>Introduction</h2>

Before you begin contributing to the main DLF MAWG website, we recommend becoming familiar with command line interfaces, Git, GitHub, Github Pages, and Jekyll.

Understanding [**the GitHub flow**](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which this workflow largley uses, will go a long way to ensuring that your experience with this group is a pleasant one! 

To facilitate this learning, the DLF MAWG maintains a skill-building resource that can be found on the DLF MAWG website's [Skillbuilding](http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/Skillbuilding) page. Topics addressed in this resource include:

- The command line.

- Git.

- GitHub.

- And more!

In addition to these resources, you may also find the following resources useful:

- [**Github's Learning Lab**](https://lab.github.com/): This resource provides interactive tutorials on numerous topics.

- [**Learning GitHub**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github): This LinkedIn Learning course provides a broad overview of GitHub and Git.

- [**GitHub Documentation**](https://docs.github.com/en): GitHub's official documentation, which was used to create this website.

As you begin to experiment with Git, GitHub, and Jekyll, just remember that:

- Mistakes are very easily reversed - so please feel free to experiment!

- If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please reach out the DLF MAWG group members listed in the [**Maintenance**](maintenance) page. They will be happy to help you out!

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

Once you are more familiar these topics, or if you are a GitHub veteran, please navigate to the [**Installation**](installation) page to begin installing necessary software setting up your GitHub environments.
