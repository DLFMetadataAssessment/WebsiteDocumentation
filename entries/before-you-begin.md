# Introduction

Before you begin contributing changes to the DLF MAWG website, we recommend becoming somewhat familiar with command line interfaces, Git, GitHub, Github Pages, and Jekyll.

In particular, reviewing and more fully understanding [the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and jargon--including the various kinds of repositories, pull requests, pushing changes, etc.--will go a long way to ensuring your experience with Git and GitHub is an altogether pleasurable one. 

To facilitate this learning, the DLF MAWG maintains a skill-building resource that can be found here: [http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/Skillbuilding](http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/Skillbuilding). 

Topics addressed in this resource include:

- The command line.

- Git.

- GitHub.

-  And more!

In addition to these resources, you may find the following resources useful:

- [**Github's Learning Lab**](https://lab.github.com/): This resource provides interactive tutorials on numerous topics--including various programming languages and GitHub.

- [**Learning GitHub**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github): This LinkedIn Learning course provides a broad overview of GitHub and Git.

- [**GitHub Documentation**](https://docs.github.com/en): GitHub's official documentation, which was used to create this website.

As you begin to experiment with Git, GitHub, and Jekyll, remember two important things:

- Changes in GitHub are very easily reversed - so please experiment!

- If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please reach out the DLF MAWG group members listed in the [Maintenance](maintenance) page. They will be happy to answer your questions and help you out!

-Finally, this documentation is intended to be used to update the DLF MAWG's [Sandbox](https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/Sandbox) and [Production](https://github.com/DLFMetadataAssessment/DLFMetadataAssessment.github.io) websites. However, its core components and workflow can be adapted for any GitHub project.

# Next Steps 

Once you are more familiar with relevant core concepts, move on to the [**Installation**](installation) page.
