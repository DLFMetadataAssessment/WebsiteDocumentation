<h2>Introduction</h2>

Before you begin contributing to DLF MAWG's sites, we recommend becoming familiar with command line interfaces, Git, GitHub, Github Pages, and Jekyll.

Understanding [**the GitHub flow**](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) will go a long way to ensuring that your experience with this group is a pleasant one! 

To facilitate this learning, the DLF MAWG maintains a skill-building resource that can be found on the DLF MAWG website's [**Skillbuilding**](http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/skillbuilding) page. Topics addressed in this resource include:

- The command line.

- Git.

- GitHub.

- And more!

In addition to these resources, you may also find the following resources useful:

- [**Learning GitHub**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github): This LinkedIn Learning course provides a broad overview of GitHub and Git.

- [**GitHub Documentation**](https://docs.github.com/en): GitHub's official documentation, which was used to create this website.

As you begin to experiment with Git, GitHub, and Jekyll, just remember that:

- Mistakes are very easily reversed - so please feel free to experiment!

- If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please reach out the DLF MAWG group members listed in the [**Maintenance**](maintenance) page. They will be happy to help you out!

<h2>Using this Site</h2>

When using this site, pay attention to the following stylized text:

- Words marked in special triple quotes ```like this text``` are partial or complete text that you will directly type into a command line tool of your choosing.

- Words that are italicized *like this text* refer to text you will need to type into a command line tool of your choosing, but may vary depending on your particular setup or situation. 

- Words that are bolded **like this text** typically refer to various items of importance, including those interactables that will need to click on but which you typically will not be typing into GitHub. Links on this site are also bolded.

Typically, special ```triple quoted text``` *and italicized text* will be paired together to indicate special combinations of text you will need to type into your command line tool to effect a particular command or change. 

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

Once you are more familiar these topics, or if you are a Git/GitHub veteran, please navigate to the [**Installation**](installation) page to begin installing necessary software and setting up your environments.
