# Introduction

This page serves as a glossary for various Github- and Jekyll-specific terms on this site. Terms, their definitions, and citations are provided below.

If you would like to suggest a term be added to this glossary, please contribute suggestions using the workflow outlined [in the *Contributing to the Website* portion of this site.](contributing-to-site). However, make sure the issues are associated with this repository and not the main DLF MAWG website.

# Terms

**TERM TEMPLATE**: Term definition.

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**: "A text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface. Other names for the command line are: *cmd*, *CLI*, *prompt*, *console* or *terminal*" ([Introduction to the command-line interface](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)).

**Git**: "Git is an open source version control software. Think of it as a way to manage multiple people working on the same project; Git allows them to smartly “merge” changes to avoid conflicts. It also keeps a history of the project, so that you can roll back to a time before an error was introduced" ([ Library Code Year’s GitHub Tutorial](https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project/blob/master/Getting%20Started/readme.mdown#what-is-git-what-is-github)).

**GitHub**: "GitHub is a cloud-based storage site for git. It is a central place where everyone can download projects, track ongoing issues, and view information. It’s not the only such site" [ Library Code Year’s GitHub Tutorial](https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project/blob/master/Getting%20Started/readme.mdown#what-is-git-what-is-github)).

**GitHub Pages**: "GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website" ([About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)).

**Local repository (GitHub)**: A version of your project that exists in a local environment (i.e. your computer).

**Jekyll**: "Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website" ([Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)).

**Pull (GitHub)**: Term definition.

**Push (GitHub)**: Term definition.

**Repository (GitHub)**: The place that "contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository" ([About repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-repositories)).

**Remote repository (GitHub)**: A version "of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere" ([Git Basics - Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes#:~:text=Remote%20repositories%20are%20versions%20of,or%20read%2Fwrite%20for%20you.)).
