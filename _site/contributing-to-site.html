<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Now that you have installed all necessary dependencies as well as configured your repositories, you are ready to begin contributing changes to the DLF website!</p>

<p>To facilitate contributing to the DLF MetadataAssessment repositories, we have provided two similar workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first workflow primarily avoids the command line, and is envisioned as appropriate for those entirely new to Git and GitHub.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second workflow employs more of the command line. <strong>We recommend using the second workflow once you become more familiar with Git, GitHub, and the GitHub workflow.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="high-level-workflow">High Level Workflow</h1>

<p>Regardless of which workflow you use, the general workflow for contributing changes is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the appropriate original repository and review the issue you want to change.</li>
  <li>Update your fork.</li>
  <li>Update your local repository.</li>
  <li>Use a text editor to effect changes.</li>
  <li>Testing that the issue has been resolved.</li>
  <li>Create a new branch.</li>
  <li>Push the changed content into that new branch.</li>
  <li>Create a pull request to merge the proposed changes into the original repository.</li>
  <li>Assign reviewers.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have contributed changes, the following workflow will be used to incorporate those changes into the original repository:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Review the change.</li>
  <li>Merging the pull request and deleting the branch.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="instructions-for-contributing-changes-minimal-command-line">Instructions for Contributing Changes (Minimal Command Line)</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to the appropriate original repository (e.g. the Sandbox) and review the issue you want to resolve.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are not assigned to this issue, select <strong>assign yourself</strong> under <strong>Assignees</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Review this video from Kate Flynn (from the time the video starts until 4:51) to learn more about how to review an issue: https://youtu.be/3fqsS2_ahXM?t=114</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your fork is in sync with the original repository by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Navigating to your fork.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting the default branch (i.e. <strong>main</strong>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting <strong>Fetch Upstream</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>(Optionally) Select <strong>Compare</strong> and review.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting <strong>Fetch and Merge</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your local repository is in sync with your fork by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Opening a terminal.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Navigating to folder on your computer containing your local repository, and further navigate into the folder containing the <strong>README file.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensuring you are on the default branch by typing the following into the terminal: <strong>git checkout DEFAULT BRANCH NAME</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The DLF MAWG’s default branch name is <strong>main</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Typing and entiering <strong>gill pull origin DEFAULT BRANCH NAME</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you encounter a message like <strong>Your branch is up to date with ‘origin/DEFAULT BRANCH NAME’</strong> then proceed to the next step.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a text editor of your choice, and using the notes and information in the issue, <strong>fix the issue in your local repository.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing that the issue has been resolved. <strong>For repositories that use Jekyll</strong>, this will involve:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Navigating to your terminal, which should still be opened to local repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Running <strong>bundle exec jekyll serve</strong> to start Jekyll.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Navigating to the provided <strong>Server Address</strong> (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:4000) and reviewing the change.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you’re ready so implement the change, select or create the branch that will house that change:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Navigate to your <strong>fork</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Select the branch drop-down menu and type the name of your branch into the search bar:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If you have already created a branch for this change, type that branch name into the search bar and select it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you need to create a new branch, type the name of the branch into the search bar and select the <strong>create branch</strong> option.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: Our branch naming convention is <strong>issue#</strong> followed by a four character number that represents the issue number. So, for a branch that resolves issue 189, the branch name would be issue#0189.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update the branch by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Navigating to the <strong>appropriate directory</strong> in the fork. For example, if you changed a file that was in the <strong>entries</strong> sub-folder, make sure you select that sub-folder before proceeding to the next step.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting <strong>Add file</strong> and then <strong>Upload files.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dragging and dropping the changed file(s) from your local repository to the <strong>Drag additional files here…</strong> bar.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Scrolling to the bottom of the page, adding a title to your change (such as <strong>Fixes issue#0189</strong>) and any relevant descriptive information (such as <strong>This also resolves a similar typographical issue in the breadcrumb</strong>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting <strong>Commit directly to the BRANCH NAME branch</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a pull request to merge the content on the branch in your fork with the original repository:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Navigate to the main page of your fork.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Select the <strong>Compare &amp; Pull Request</strong> button for the branch you just made.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If not already selected, click <strong>Compare across forks</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>Base repository</strong> is the original repository (e.g. DLFMetadataAssessment/Sandbox).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>base</strong> branch is the default branch (e.g. <strong>main</strong>).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>Head Repository</strong> is your fork.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The <strong>compare</strong> branch is the branch on your repository is the branch on your fork with the changed files.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Review the title and description of the change and select <strong>Create Pull Request</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because no one is supposed to merge their own pull request into the original repository, complete this workflow by assigning a reviewer:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting <strong>Reviewers</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Clicking on the search bar and selecting the name of the member you want to review this change.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h1 id="reviewing-and-approving-changes">Reviewing and Approving Changes</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have been assigned to a change, review the change by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Reviewing the title and description of the pull request and comparing it to the original issue, to ensure the actual issue was nominally addressed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Reviewing the <strong>Files Changed</strong> tab to confirm that the change was actually implemented.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Checking to ensure there are no branch conflicts.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Note</strong>: If there are branch conflicts, please reach out the DLF MAWG group members listed in the <a href="maintenance">Maintenance</a> page to resolve this issue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you are satisfied this change is sufficient, merge the branch into the original repository by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Clicking the <strong>Merge Pull Request</strong> drop-down arrow and ensuring that <strong>Create a Merge Commit</strong> is selected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Selecting <strong>Merge pull request</strong>.</p>
